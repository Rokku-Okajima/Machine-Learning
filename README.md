Hello there! 

Welcome to my personal machine learning project repository. Whether you're a curious user or a potential employer, thank you for taking the time to check out my work.

Project Overview:
    This repository contains my early work on building machine learning models for stock price prediction and other related applications. It is currently a work in progress, 
and I plan to update it regularly with improvements and new features.

Future plan:
  
  In the future, I plan to:
* Implement deep learning models for more accurate predictions

* Develop an advisory system using AI to assist in trading decisions

* Add more real-world datasets and tools for analysis

Stay tuned as I continue to learn and grow in this field!
